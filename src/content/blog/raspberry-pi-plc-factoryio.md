Who says you need expensive hardware to learn PLC programming? This video demonstrates a Raspberry Pi running a PLC runtime and controlling a Factory I/O industrial simulation over Modbus TCP.

## The Setup

- **Raspberry Pi** running a PLC runtime with Structured Text programs
- **Factory I/O** on a separate PC providing 3D industrial simulation
- **Modbus TCP** as the communication protocol between them

Factory I/O is a popular industrial simulation tool that provides realistic 3D environments - conveyor systems, sorting stations, tank filling operations, and more. By connecting it to a real PLC runtime over Modbus TCP, you get a hands-on learning environment that behaves like a real plant.

## Why This Matters

This kind of setup is invaluable for:

- **Learning** - Practice PLC programming without expensive hardware
- **Testing** - Validate control logic before deploying to real equipment
- **Training** - Teach operators and engineers on realistic simulations
- **Development** - Test new features and algorithms in a safe environment

The Raspberry Pi costs under $100, and Factory I/O is available for educational licensing. Combined, they create a complete automation training lab that fits on a desk.
