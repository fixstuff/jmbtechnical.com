One of GOPLC's strengths is the ability to build operator interfaces without needing separate HMI software. This demo shows how to create a simple HMI directly within the GOPLC environment.

## What's Shown

The video demonstrates creating an operator-facing HMI panel using GOPLC's integrated tools. Rather than requiring a separate SCADA or HMI package, GOPLC provides built-in visualization capabilities that run directly alongside the PLC logic.

This approach simplifies the architecture - one runtime handles both control logic and operator interface, reducing the number of moving parts in a system.

## Why It Matters

In traditional automation, you need separate software licenses for PLC programming and HMI development. GOPLC combines both into a single platform, which means:

- **Fewer licenses** to manage
- **Tighter integration** between control logic and display
- **Faster development** since everything lives in one environment
- **Web-based access** from any browser on the network
